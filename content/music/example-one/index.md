here is some paragraph text. i am going to keep putting stuff here so everything is all good and cool. check out this cool bandcamp snippet:

{{< bandcamp caption="i like this song" >}}
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1076351671/size=small/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://vulfpeck.bandcamp.com/album/clarity-of-cal">Clarity of Cal by Vulfpeck</a></iframe>
{{< /bandcamp >}}

## heading 2

this is some more paragraph text. also, here is a list

- item one
- item two
- item three
- item four

also here is some **bold text**. and here is some *italic* text. personally, i think this font's italic type is a bit aggressive.

> while we are at it, here is text in a block quote. i personally love block quotes. they are so fun and cool looking.

## okay back to real stuff

here is a picture that i found on the internet

{{< figure
  src="my-picture.jpg"
  width="300px"
  alt="A photograph of Zion National Park"
  link="my-picture.jpg"
  caption="a random picture i found, centered"
  class="center"
>}}

here is what the picture looks like without specifiying size (it will just take up the page width). this one also does not have a link

{{< figure
  src="my-picture.jpg"
  caption="wow look at this picture huh?"
>}}
