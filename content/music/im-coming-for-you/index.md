this one really came from the heart. i put everything i had into this song. and by that, i mean i put absolutely fucking nothing into this song. god, someone please help. i just need someone to take out my trash or clean my dishes. someone to think about when im sitting alone at the coffee shop.

i don't know how to eat crayons and better than the next person, but it really hurts when i see her doing that.

## chapter 2

id really love it if she would stop eating my crayons. every time i want to use the color green, i can't find any and i have to use blue and yellow instead. green must be her favorite color to taste on her lips and in her mouth.

## chapter 3

here are the reasons why i think i might try eating crayons myself:

- i want to figure out if the wax will be soft or crunchy. my heart says soft but i have a hard time trusting myself.

## the finale

well, here we fucking go again. i tried eating crayons yesterday and it went TERRIBLE. why does this always happen to me? i fucking knew this story would end this way, just like they always do. the machine wouldn't let me take more than six at a time. i put in the code just like they told me to, but it rejected me. i tried to be silent and not wake her up but i saw her eyes twitch and her fingers move.
